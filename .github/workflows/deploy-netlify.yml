        with:
          node-version: "20" # IMPORTANT: Use a Node.js version compatible with your Angular CLI and project. '20' is generally good for modern Angular.

        with:
          path: ~/.npm # The path to cache (where npm stores modules)
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }} # A unique key based on OS and your package-lock.json (changes when dependencies change)

            ${{ runner.os }}-node- # Fallback key if an exact match isn't found

          npm install -g @angular/cli # Installs Angular CLI globally on the runner
          npm install # Installs all your project's dependencies listed in package.json

      - name: Build Angular app for production
        run: ng build --configuration=production # This command executes your Angular production build, creating the 'dist' folder

      - name: Deploy to Netlify
        uses: nwtgck/actions-netlify@v3.0 # This is a popular GitHub Action that simplifies deploying to Netlify
        with:
          # IMPORTANT: Set this path to the exact folder created inside 'dist/' by your 'ng build' command.
          # Based on your previous logs, this is likely 'expense-tracker'.
          publish-dir: ./dist/expense-tracker/browser # E.g., if ng build creates 'dist/my-app', use './dist/my-app'

          production-branch: main # Specifies that this deployment is for your production branch (main)
